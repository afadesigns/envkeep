# Support

We provide the following support channels:

- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request features using the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask usage questions or share ideas with the community.

## Service Levels
- Bug triage within two business days.
- Security disclosures acknowledged within 24 hours (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).
- Documentation issues tracked in Docs board with weekly updates.

If your organization needs a support agreement, start a GitHub discussion tagged `type:partnership` so the maintainer can follow up directly.
