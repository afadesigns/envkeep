# Governance

Envkeep follows a lightweight stewardship model.

## Roles
- **Maintainers**: Responsible for roadmap curation, release management, and reviewing contributions. Current maintainers are members of the @rtx-labs/platform team.
- **Contributors**: Anyone submitting issues, patches, or documentation updates.
- **Advisors**: Trusted community members consulted on major changes (breaking APIs, security posture).

## Decision Making
- Day-to-day decisions are made by maintainers through pull request reviews and issue triage.
- Proposals that change public APIs or compatibility guarantees require an RFC in a GitHub Discussion, open for at least seven days.
- Security fixes may bypass the public RFC window at the discretion of maintainers.

## Releases
- Maintainers rotate release duties. Each release must follow the checklist in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
- Patch releases focus on bug fixes; minor releases may add features; major releases can include breaking changes.

## Escalation
If no maintainer responds to a critical issue within 72 hours, email maintainers@rtx-labs.com to escalate.
