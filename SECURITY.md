## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the "Report a vulnerability" form at https://github.com/afadesigns/envkeep/security/advisories/new to privately disclose issues. Include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce the problem. We aim to acknowledge reports within two business days and provide a remediation timeline within one week.

## Disclosure Process
1. We triage the report and confirm the issue.
2. A fix is developed and validated in private branches.
3. A security release is published with coordinated disclosure and changelog entry.
4. Credit is granted to the reporter unless anonymity is requested.

We welcome responsible disclosure and will never pursue legal action for good-faith research that complies with this policy.
