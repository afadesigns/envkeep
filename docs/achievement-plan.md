# GitHub Achievements Plan

## Quickdraw
- Open a template verification issue via GitHub CLI immediately after repository creation.
- Close the issue within five minutes after confirming templates render correctly.

## YOLO
- Merge the initial documentation typo fix branch without requesting review once CI is green and tests pass.
- Add a PR note explaining the deliberate YOLO action to keep history transparent.

## Pull Shark
- Prepare two feature branches (`feat/ci-badge`, `feat/spec-lint`) with meaningful changes.
- Open pull requests for each and merge them after review (one self-review + maintainer approval, one cross-checked).

## Starstruck
- Launch plan targets 16+ stars in the first 30 days by coordinating announcements on r/Python, Hacker News (Show HN), Dev.to, and LinkedIn.
- Offer live demo sessions for configuration and SRE communities, capture feedback, and publish testimonials in docs.
- Promote quarterly feature drops with blog posts and newsletter swaps to accelerate toward 128+ stars and beyond.
