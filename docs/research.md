# Research Dossier

## Trend Scan Highlights
- Secrets and configuration drift incidents remain top of mind following GitHub Actions supply-chain breaches that leaked cloud credentials, driving demand for stronger guardrails around environment variables and CI configuration ([CISA AA24-241A](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/08/28/multiple-threat-actors-leverage-github-actions-steal-authentication-secrets)).
- Python teams lament brittle `.env` files and manual config syncing; community discussions show appetite for safer tooling combining validation, secrets hygiene, and drift detection ([r/devops "What is your biggest pain point?" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1f5k3jc/what_is_your_biggest_pain_point_on_your_way_to/), [EnvVar drift blog](https://blog.devfont.com/config-drift-dotenv/)).
- Lightweight `.env` linters and syncing utilities trend on GitHub and Reddit, but adoption stalls once teams need typed guarantees, environment diffing, and multi-profile support ([dotenv-linter](https://github.com/wemake-services/dotenv-linter) #686 stars, [dotenvhub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ezuhtd/my_new_open_source_project_dotenvhub/), [dotenvx](https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx)).
- Developers seek automated checkpoints to catch misconfigured deployment pipelines, especially as infrastructure-as-code and polyglot stacks deepen configuration surface area ([r/devops GitOps thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1bsv8d0/what_are_your_biggest_pain_points_with/)).

## Candidate Directions (Ranked)
1. **Envkeep – deterministic environment spec & drift guard** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium). Offers typed spec in `envkeep.toml`, drift-aware diffing, secrets hygiene, and CLI + library parity. Builds on `.env` pain point momentum while avoiding heavy dependencies.
2. **ActionLock – GitHub Actions supply-chain linting** (Impact: High, Effort: High). Validates pinned actions, blocked network calls, and secret scopes. Competitive field (StepSecurity, CISA advisories) and higher maintenance burden for workflow parsers.
3. **MigraLab – database migration rehearsal harness** (Impact: Medium, Effort: High). Replays migrations in ephemeral containers with regression snapshots. Requires polyglot database expertise and complex tooling to differentiate from Atlas or Bytebase.

## Selected Direction
Envkeep is chosen because it attacks a pervasive, recently spotlighted pain point—keeping environment definitions, secrets hygiene, and multi-stage configs consistent—where existing tools either stop at linting or require adopting heavyweight configuration frameworks. Envkeep’s differentiator is a single typed spec that powers validation, drift diffing, sample generation, and CI enforcement with minimal dependencies, making it practical for teams who already rely on `.env` files but need stronger guarantees without replatforming.
